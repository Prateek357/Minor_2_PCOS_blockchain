# Analysis Plan for Blockchain-based File Storage System

## Overview
This document outlines the analysis of the Blockchain-based File Storage System, detailing its structure, key components, and interactions.

## Key Components
1. **Backend**
   - **Flask**: Web framework for handling requests and responses.
   - **MongoDB**: Database for storing user data and file metadata.
   - **Blockchain Node**: Manages transactions related to file uploads and downloads.
   - **Bcrypt**: Handles password hashing for secure user authentication.
   - **Flask-Login**: Manages user sessions and authentication.

2. **Frontend**
   - **Bootstrap**: Provides responsive design for the user interface.
   - **Jinja2**: Templating engine for rendering dynamic HTML content.

## File Structure
- **app/**
  - `__init__.py`: Initializes the Flask app and sets up extensions.
  - `views.py`: Contains route handlers for user authentication and file management.
  - `templates/`: HTML templates for rendering views.
  - `static/`: Static assets like CSS and uploaded files.

- **config.py**: Configuration settings for the application.
- **block_accessor.py**: CLI tool for accessing blockchain data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists dependencies for the project.

## Interactions
- Users can register, log in, upload files, and view blocks of transactions.
- File uploads are encrypted and stored in the blockchain, ensuring security and immutability.
- The application uses Flask-Login for session management and user authentication.

## Areas for Improvement
- Consider implementing additional security measures, such as rate limiting on login attempts.
- Explore the possibility of adding more detailed logging for user actions and system events.
- Review the user interface for usability improvements.

## Follow-Up Steps
- Verify the functionality of the application by running it and testing key features.
- Consider conducting user testing to gather feedback on the interface and user experience.
